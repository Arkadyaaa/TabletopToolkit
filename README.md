# TabletopToolkit
A java program to assist creating and hosting tabletop games.

TabletopToolkit allows users to create tabletop games using Java and JavaFX. This tool is built to be modular, meaning you can replace any part into what you like. The main goal of this program is to have easily distributable game files for anyone to contribute board games for anyone to host and play.

TabletopToolkit has the essentials such as the Game screen, Inventory, Wheel of Choices / Dice Roll / Coinflip, and Players List. This allows you to host board games with your friends with you having full control. This will not have a multiplayer support, so only the host would be able to move the elements on the game screen.

This app is currently in development. None of the modules are in its final state.
As of 3/30/25, this app is still not ready for use on actual tabletop games.
